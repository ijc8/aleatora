Max: (mostly) static graph, two languages (precise timing, imprecise timing)
ChucK: graph + code to manipulate graph - both precise, but with separate interfaces
WebAudio: graph + code to manipulate graph (precise timing, imprecise timing)
My goal: single language/interface - graph implicit in execution flow - precise timing
